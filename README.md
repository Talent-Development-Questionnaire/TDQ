# TDQ
Talent Development Questionnaire - Going Virtual is a project to digitize surveys given by our client that allows athletes to give anonymous feedback vital aspects of their development experiences, like through coaching. It is a tool used by researchers and coaches to gain further knowledge as to how they can develop as a coach in the future. Previously this would be undertaken through physical questionnaires filled out by the athletes.
# Features List
The application has been created to do the following: 
1) Allow coaches to send questionnaires to athletes to gain anonymous feedback on their coaching
2) Allow coaches to create groups of athletes emails to allow a group of people to be sent a questionnaire at the press of a button
3) Allow coaches to look at the strengths and weaknesses of their coaching through scores given by the athletes
4) Allow coaches to create goals to where they can improve on their coaching
5) Allow coaches the option of sending a long 59 question questionniare or a short 28 question questionnaire
6) Allow coaches to create accounts to keep all this data in one place, but allow athletes to answer the questionnaire without an account
